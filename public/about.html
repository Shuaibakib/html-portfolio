<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Shuaib Ogirima Akibu. i Aam 22 years old, born on the 21st of July 2001. I am Nigerian, born in Lagos State but my parents are from Kogi State so that passes as my state of origin. I am a graduate of the university of Ilorin, Kwara state and i hold a Bachelors degree in Agricultural Sciences. I graduated with a Second class which really isn't the best, i believe i could have done better but that's by the way. Wasn't really involved in any extracurricular activity in school so i was always indoors but it was still fun in it's own way, i enjoy being by myself.</p>

<p>I have 4 siblings,2 older brothers, a younger brother and a younger sister. My native language is Igbira, i speak it fluently (sometimes), i speak good English, i can also speak a bit of Yoruba and something we call Broken English/Pidgin in NIgeria. I actually love the idea of learning new languages, would love to learn to speak French and Spanish but i don't particularly have the luxury of time to pursue that at the moment. I love to play video games and i sometimes listen to music. I don't really have a favorite artist, i just listen to whatever i think i need at the moment but there are notable musicians i often listen to; J hus, Omah Lay, Jidenna, Khalid, Wizkid, Burna boy, Harry styles. I don't hate being outdoors, i just prefer to be in my room. I love watching Anime and i can say i have seen quite a lot but i don't qualify as a weeb, i just watch it for the fun, the Japanese Animators know how to make just about anything interesting. I won't say i love eating but yeah i eat, i find it really tasking sometimes. If i had my way, i would love to eat only when i want to not because i need to, honestly. I think i should stop here, enough about me.</p>
